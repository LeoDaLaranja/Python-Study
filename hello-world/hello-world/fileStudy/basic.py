When you're manipulating a file, there are two ways that you can use to ensure that a file is closed properly, even when encoutergin an erro.
'''

try:
    reader = file
finally:
    file.close()

#other way to close a file is to use the With statement

with open('basic.txt') as reader:
    print("Success")

'''
perhaps you must want to use the second positional argument, mode 
there are some of them here

r -> Open for reading
w -> Open for writing, truncating(overwriting) the file first
rb or wb -> Open on binary mode (read/write using byte data)

'''

#Buffered binary file 

'''
A buffered binary file type is used for reading and writing binary files

open('abc.txt','rb')
or 
open('abc.txt','wb')
'''

#Raw files type 

'''
generally used as low-level building-block for binary and text streams
not tipically used 
'''

__file__ attribute is a special attribute of modules, similar to __name__. It is:
The pathname of the file from which the module was loaded, if it was loaded from a file
